# Bootstrap Movie Page

## This is my task from *Junior Front-End Developer Course* organized by infoShare Academy and NetCamp in Szczecin. Course duration from 13th of January to 15th of July 2018.

The task was to build a page using Bootstrap v 3.3.7 library components. Task requirements:
* Prepare page containing list of about 20 movie titles using any Bootstrap components you want

Movie section requirements:
* Title
* Description
* Your movie rating (e.g. proper stars quantity)
* Movie thumbnail
* Link button to one of the movie rating page e.g. Rotten Tomatoes
* Your best 3 titles should marked or highlighted somehow (e.g. "The best" label, different colour, or any other)
* Your worst title also should be marked or highlighted somehow
